# Auto Composter Modifications Summary

## Overview
The Auto Composter macro has been enhanced with specific timing-based features as requested:

1. **B Key Press Before Teleport**: Automatically presses the B key (inventory) when the composter needs filling, but BEFORE the teleport/movement begins
2. **Three-Command End Sequence**: Executes `/warp garden` → `/ez-listfarms` → `/ez-startscript netherwart:1` with randomized delays at the end of the cycle

## Technical Implementation

### New State Tracking Flags
- `needsToFillComposter`: Boolean flag that tracks when the composter check determines it needs filling
- `hasPressedB`: Boolean flag that ensures B key is pressed only once per cycle
- `hasExecutedListFarms`: Boolean flag that tracks if `/ez-listfarms` has been executed in this cycle
- `hasExecutedStartScript`: Boolean flag that tracks if `/ez-startscript netherwart:1` has been executed in this cycle

### Key Modifications

#### 1. Flag Declaration (Lines 87-90)
```java
private boolean needsToFillComposter = false; // Flag to track if we need to proceed with filling
private boolean hasPressedB = false; // Flag to track if we've pressed B key for this cycle
private boolean hasExecutedListFarms = false; // Flag to track if we've executed /ez-listfarms
private boolean hasExecutedStartScript = false; // Flag to track if we've executed /ez-startscript
```

#### 2. Flag Initialization in start() Method (Lines 139-142)
All flags are reset to false at the beginning of each new cycle to ensure clean state.

#### 3. Composter Check Logic (Line 547)
In the `CHECK_COMPOSTER` case, when the system determines the composter needs filling:
```java
needsToFillComposter = true; // Flag that we determined we need to fill
```

#### 4. B Key Press Logic (Lines 330-342)
In the `TELEPORT_TO_COMPOSTER` case, the B key is pressed with proper timing:
- Only triggers if `needsToFillComposter` is true AND `hasPressedB` is false
- Uses `KeyBindUtils.setKeyBindState()` to press and release the inventory key
- Includes a 200ms delay after pressing to ensure proper timing
- Prevents multiple presses per cycle

#### 5. Enhanced End Sequence Logic (Lines 275-306)
In the `END` case, when `needsToFillComposter` is true, executes a three-command sequence:
- **Phase 1**: `/warp garden` command with 1.1-1.4s randomized delay
- **Phase 2**: `/ez-listfarms` command with 1.1-1.4s randomized delay
- **Phase 3**: `/ez-startscript netherwart:1` command
- Resets all flags after completion

## Behavior Flow

1. **Normal Operation**: Composter check determines if filling is needed
2. **Flag Setting**: If filling is needed, `needsToFillComposter` = true
3. **B Key Press**: Before teleport starts, B key is pressed once if needed
4. **Macro Execution**: Normal composter filling logic proceeds
5. **Three-Command End Sequence**: If filling was needed, executes the sequential command chain
6. **Reset**: All flags are reset for the next cycle

## Command Sequence Details

The end sequence now executes three commands in order:
1. `/warp garden` (1.1-1.4s delay)
2. `/ez-listfarms` (1.1-1.4s delay) 
3. `/ez-startscript netherwart:1`

Each command has proper state tracking to ensure:
- Commands execute in the correct order
- No duplicate command execution
- Proper delays between commands
- Clean reset for next cycle

## Timing Details

- **B Key Press**: 200ms delay after pressing before continuing with teleport
- **End Sequence Delays**: 1.1-1.4 seconds (randomized) between each command
- **Key Release**: B key is properly released after the delay period

## Debug Messages
Added specific debug messages for tracking:
- "Pressing B key before starting travel..."
- "Released B key, starting teleport..."
- "Executing end sequence: /warp garden"
- "Executing end sequence: /ez-listfarms"
- "Executing end sequence: /ez-startscript netherwart:1"

## Build Status
✅ Successfully compiled and built as `Composters-1.0.0.jar`
✅ All modifications integrated without breaking existing functionality
✅ Proper state management ensures no conflicts with existing logic
