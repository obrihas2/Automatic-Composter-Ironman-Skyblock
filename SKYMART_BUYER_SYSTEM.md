## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Three-Tier Buyer System**

#### 1. **BiofuelBuyer** - Individual Fuel Purchasing
- **Purpose**: Purchase Biofuel (Green Dye) only
- **Cost**: 20,000 coins per Biofuel
- **Use Case**: When only fuel is needed

#### 2. **BoxOfSeedsBuyer** - Individual Organic Matter Purchasing  
- **Purpose**: Purchase Box of Seeds only
- **Cost**: Variable market price
- **Use Case**: When only organic matter is needed

#### 3. **UnifiedSkyMartBuyer** - Multi-Item Purchasing ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- **Purpose**: Purchase multiple items in one session
- **Benefits**: Maximum efficiency, fewer GUI navigations, retry logic
- **Use Case**: When both fuel and organic matter are needed

### **Smart Buying Logic**
AutoComposter automatically chooses the most efficient buyer based on:
- What items are needed (fuel, matter, or both)
- Configuration settings
- Inventory availability

## üõ†Ô∏è **State Machine Architecture**

```

#### **BoxOfSeedsBuyer Logs**
```
[BoxOfSeedsBuyer] Starting Box of Seeds purchase - Amount: X
[BoxOfSeedsBuyer] State transition: OLD_STATE ‚Üí NEW_STATE

```

#### **UnifiedSkyMartBuyer Logs**  
```

```

#### **AutoComposter Integration Logs**
```
[Auto Composter] Checking composter resources
[Auto Composter] Organic Matter: X/Y
[Auto Composter] Fuel: X/Y

```

## üöÄ **Workflow Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Need Both Fuel and Organic Matter**
```
1. AutoComposter detects low fuel (< threshold) and low organic matter
2. Checks inventory: missing both Biofuel and Box of Seeds  
3. Uses UnifiedSkyMartBuyer (most efficient)
4. Single session: /desk ‚Üí SkyMart ‚Üí Farming Essentials  
5. Purchases both items with retry logic
6. Returns to composter and fills with purchased items
```

### **Scenario 2: Need Only Fuel**
```
1. AutoComposter detects low fuel but adequate organic matter
2. Checks inventory: missing only Biofuel
3. Uses BiofuelBuyer (specialized)  
4. Purchases Biofuel: /desk ‚Üí SkyMart ‚Üí Farming Essentials ‚Üí Biofuel
5. Returns to composter and fills with Biofuel
```

### **Scenario 3: Need Only Organic Matter**
```
1. AutoComposter detects adequate fuel but low organic matter  
2. Checks inventory: missing only Box of Seeds
3. Uses BoxOfSeedsBuyer (specialized)
4. Purchases Box of Seeds: /desk ‚Üí SkyMart ‚Üí Farming Essentials ‚Üí Box of Seeds
5. Returns to composter and fills with Box of Seeds  
```

## üîß **Error Handling & Recovery**

### **Timeout Handling**
- Each GUI state has configurable timeouts
- Failed GUI navigation ‚Üí FAILED state ‚Üí continues without items
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### **Retry Logic (UnifiedSkyMartBuyer)**
- Up to 3 retry attempts for failed purchases
- Partial purchase detection and completion
- Item-specific retry (only retry failed items)

### **Graceful Degradation**
- If buyer fails ‚Üí AutoComposter continues with available items
- No system crashes or infinite loops
- Comprehensive error logging

## üß™ **Testing & Validation**

### **Unit Test Coverage**
- `SkyMartBuyerTest.java` - 165 comprehensive test cases
- State machine validation
- Configuration effect testing  
- Error condition handling
- Buyer interaction testing

### **Test Categories**
1. **Initial State Tests** - Verify correct starting states
2. **State Transition Tests** - Validate state machine flow
3. **Configuration Tests** - Verify config changes affect behavior  
4. **Error Handling Tests** - Test timeout and failure scenarios
5. **Integration Tests** - Test buyer interactions

## üö® **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"Failed to open desk - timeout"**
```
Solution: Increase biofuelBuyerTimeout or add biofuelBuyerGUIDelay
Location: Auto Composter ‚Üí BiofuelBuyer ‚Üí BiofuelBuyer Timeout (ms)
```

#### **"Cannot find SkyMart button in Desk"**  
```
Solution: Check if /desk command worked, verify GUI detection
Debug: Enable biofuelBuyerDebugLogging to see GUI names
```

#### **"Cannot find Biofuel in Farming Essentials"**
```
Solution: Item might be called "Green Dye" - buyer handles alternatives
Debug: Check exact item names in Farming Essentials GUI
```

#### **"Purchase incomplete for X: got Y, needed Z"**
```
Solution: Normal - UnifiedSkyMartBuyer will retry failed items
Action: Check retry logs, increase unifiedSkyMartBuyerMaxRetries if needed
```
